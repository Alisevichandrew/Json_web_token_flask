If the terminal gives an error:
RuntimeError: The session is unavailable because no secret key was set.  Set the secret_key on the application to something unique and secret.
then it is necessary to generate the key in the following code:

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = ''

to do this, we write in the terminal: 

python -c 'import os; print(os.urandom(16))'

then it will generate a code, for example:

b'Z\x864\x94\x8a\xf2\x92\x1c\xb1&\xda\xff\x84\xdfc\x8c'
